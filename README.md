# CRM System using Django

## Overview

A Customer Relationship Management system built with Django 5.1.7 for managing customer records with user authentication and CRUD operations. The application provides a web-based interface for businesses to store, manage, and retrieve customer information efficiently.

## Technical Architecture

The system is developed using Django 5.1.7 framework with SQLite3 as the database backend for development purposes. The application leverages Django's built-in authentication system to provide secure user access and session management. The architecture follows the Model-View-Template pattern typical of Django applications.

The project consists of two main components: the CRM directory containing the Django project configuration files, and the web directory which houses the primary application logic. The web application includes models for data representation, views for business logic implementation, forms for user input validation, URL patterns for routing, and HTML templates for the user interface presentation.

## Data Structure

The core data model centers around customer records that store comprehensive contact information. Each customer record contains essential fields including creation timestamp, personal details such as first and last names, contact information including email address and phone number, and complete address details with city, state, and zip code components. All customer data fields are designed with appropriate character limits to ensure data integrity and optimal database performance.

## Application Functionality

The system provides comprehensive user management capabilities starting with user registration and authentication processes. Users can create accounts with validated credentials and maintain secure sessions throughout their interaction with the application. The authentication system ensures that only authorized users can access customer data and perform administrative functions.

Customer record management forms the core functionality of the system. Users can create new customer entries by filling out detailed forms with validation requirements. The system allows viewing individual customer records with complete information display, updating existing customer data through pre-populated forms, and removing customer records when necessary. All customer records are displayed in a centralized listing accessible from the main dashboard.

## Installation Process

Setting up the CRM system requires Python environment with Django framework installation. Begin by installing Django version 5.1.7 using the pip package manager. After Django installation, navigate to the project directory and execute database migrations to establish the necessary database schema. The migration process creates all required tables and relationships for proper application functionality.

Once migrations are complete, start the Django development server using the manage.py script. The application becomes accessible through the local development server, typically running on port 8000. For production deployment, additional configuration steps including debug mode deactivation and proper host settings are necessary.

## System Navigation

The application provides intuitive navigation through well-defined URL endpoints. The home page serves as the main dashboard displaying customer record listings and providing access to core functionality. User registration is handled through a dedicated registration endpoint with form validation and automatic login upon successful account creation. User logout functionality ensures secure session termination.

Individual customer records are accessible through unique identifier-based URLs allowing direct access to specific customer information. New customer creation is managed through a dedicated form interface with comprehensive validation. Customer record updates utilize pre-populated forms maintaining data integrity during modification processes. Customer deletion functionality provides secure record removal with appropriate access controls.

## Security Implementation

The application implements multiple security layers to protect user data and system integrity. Authentication requirements ensure that only registered users can access customer records and perform data operations. Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is enabled system-wide to prevent unauthorized request execution. Session management maintains secure user state throughout application interaction.

The current configuration includes debug mode activation suitable for development environments. Production deployment requires debug mode deactivation and implementation of additional security measures including secure host configuration and environment-specific secret key management.
